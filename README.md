# Escape-Game
A JavaScript game involving trying to click on the correct div, out of a set of invisible divs in randomized locations.

This game was made as a way of practicing concepts learned in the class INSY 341 (Developing Business Apps). The premise of the game is that you are trapped in a forest with a serial killer and you must find your way out in the darkness. You must click anywhere in the browser window to try to find help. Click on the correct div, and you win, but click on the wrong div, and you lose. Furthermore, you must find your way out of the forest before the time is up.

To begin playing, open index.html and click on the link to play.html, or just open play.html.
